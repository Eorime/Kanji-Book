          As a lifelong language lover, the world of kanji has always captivated
          me. It's this fascination that inspired me to create KOTOBA - my
          one-man kanji dictionary website. With a neat and user-friendly
          design, KOTOBA is a true passion project that offers a comprehensive
          dictionary of kanji characters, displaying their readings, stroke
          orders, meanings and associated words. From beginners to advanced
          learners, KOTOBA aims to be a helpful companion on one's journey to
          kanji mastery. KOTOBA uses{" "}

          My good understanding of the challenges and joys of language learning
          drove me to craft this website as a thoughtfully designed and
          user-friendly experience. I wanted to go beyond just listing kanji - I
          aimed to create a comprehensive resource that makes learning
          enjoyable, offering study materials and insights into one of the
          Japanese writing systems.

          After creating KOTOBA, my aim is to develop a website that will offer
          interactive tools for learning multiple languages. This site will be
          in Georgian, since most language learning sites are English-based. My
          goal is to provide the Georgian-speaking community with a space to
          learn languages. It's a vision I'm passionate about, and I look
          forward to bringing it to life.
